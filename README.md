## Very BASIC Language
This was initially going to be **Yet Another BASIC Interpreter** but I decided that it would be cooler if it was just a language made by me written in Rust(which I think was a mistake). And I still don't know what I wanna do with it all I know is that I wanna learn:))))
Until now It's only a broken tokenizer:///
## Syntax
For now something like BASIC:
### Printing
It has to be simpler than the normal BASIC
```basic
print <arg>
```
### Input
```basic
input <var>
input "prompt" <var>
```
### Goto
```basic
goto <label>
```
### Asignment
```basic
<varname> = <value>
```
### For loop
```basic
for i=0 to 5
	print "Some BASIC Stuff"
next
```
## For Now
- [x] Reading Files
- [ ] CLI
- [x] Tokenizer
(still needs some work)
- [ ] Parser
- [ ] Evaluator
- [ ] Could interpret a BASIC example
## The Future
For now this is a toy interpreter for me to mess around with it and learn but when I have completely made it work I'm going to add more stuff to it to make it actually usable, but I'm going to keep things as minimal as possible because it should be a VeryBASICLanguage;))
